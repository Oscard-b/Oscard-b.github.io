            <h3>About bit about me:</h3>
            <p>
              My name is Oscar de Jesus Berrones. I graduated from Mesa High School in 2016, and then went on to start my college education
              at Arizona State University. Eventually, I realized Mesa Community College was a better fit, so I started a degree program there
              in the fall of 2017. That was where I got interested in the tech industry, and finally landed in the University of Arizona full-stack
              coding bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
              My classmates, as well as my instructor and the teaching assitsants, seem really down to earth which makes the learning process a lot easier.
              Learning new concepts at a fast pace, asking questions, participating in class whether it's in-person or online, and collaborating with others
              all feel so easy to do. Overall, I'm enjoying the bootcamp so far and am actually enjoying what I'm doing in class. The challeneges feel refreshing
              and are welcome despite all the frustration.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've worked a lot of part-time jobs during my eductional career as I've tried to save money as well as invest in something that will ultimately
              help me establish a meaningful, advantageous starting point in terms of my career path. That said, I'm excited to march down the rest
              of this semester, build a repertoire of programming knowledge, and eventually take that leap of faith into a new job environment and more abundant future.
